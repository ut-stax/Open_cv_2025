## 📅 Course Outline:

### **Intro**  
- Introduction to OpenCV and the fundamentals of computer vision. 🤖

### **Lesson 1: What are Images?**  
- Learn the basics of how images are represented and processed. 🖼️

### **Lesson 2: Input / Output**  
- Handling image input and output in OpenCV. 📥📤

### **Lesson 3: Basic Operations**  
- Working with simple operations like resizing, cropping, and manipulating images. ✂️🔄

### **Lesson 4: Colorspaces**  
- Explore different colorspaces (RGB, Grayscale, HSV) and how they affect image processing. 🌈

### **Lesson 5: Blurring**  
- Techniques for blurring images using filters like Gaussian blur. 🌫️

### **Lesson 6: Threshold**  
- Learn about thresholding techniques and how to create binary images. 🏁

### **Lesson 7: Edge Detection**  
- Master edge detection algorithms like Canny to highlight important features in an image. ✂️🖤

### **Lesson 8: Drawing**  
- Draw shapes and text on images for annotation and visualization. ✏️🖌️

### **Lesson 9: Contours**  
- Understand how to find and draw contours, helping with object detection and shape recognition. 🔍🔲

### **Bonus Lesson 🎉**  
- Extra advanced topics to dive deeper into computer vision techniques. 🤩
